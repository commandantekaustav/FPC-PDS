### 1. Objective

By the end of this session, students will be able to:
*   Define Data Science and articulate its importance.
*   Identify the key skills required for a data scientist.
*   Recognize how data science is applied in various business contexts.

### 2. Lecture & Discussion Points

#### What is Data Science?

*   **Formal Definition:** Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.
*   **Simple Analogy:** Think of a data scientist as a modern-day detective. The data is the crime scene, full of clues. The data scientist uses special tools (programming, stats) to find the important clues, piece them together to understand what happened (analysis), and predict what might happen next (modeling).

#### The DIKW Pyramid: The Goal of Data Science

The ultimate goal is not just to have data, but to derive wisdom from it.

*   **Data:** Raw, unorganized facts.
    *   *Example:* `101, Apple, 5, 1.25`
*   **Information:** Data that has been processed to be useful; it has context.
    *   *Example:* "Product ID 101, which is 'Apple', had 5 units sold at a price of $1.25 each."
*   **Knowledge:** The synthesis of information to understand relationships and patterns.
    *   *Example:* "Apples are one of our top-selling fruits, especially during the autumn months."
*   **Wisdom:** The ability to use knowledge to make effective decisions.
    *   *Example:* "We should increase our stock of apples by 30% before autumn and place them at the front of the store to maximize sales."

**Data Science is the engine that turns raw Data into Information, Knowledge, and ultimately, Wisdom.**

#### Why is it the "Sexiest Job of the 21st Century"?

*   **High Demand:** Companies in every industry are collecting massive amounts of data. They need skilled people to make sense of it.
*   **High Impact:** Data-driven decisions are more effective than decisions based on gut feelings. Data scientists directly influence business strategy and success.
*   **Interesting Challenges:** The problems are diverse and require a unique blend of creativity, logic, and technical skill.

#### The Three Core Skills of a Data Scientist (Venn Diagram)

1.  **Computer Science / Hacking Skills:**
    *   This is the ability to handle data programmatically.
    *   Skills: Python/R programming, database knowledge (SQL), working with Big Data technologies.
    *   *Role:* Getting, cleaning, and processing the data.

2.  **Math & Statistics Knowledge:**
    *   This is the scientific foundation.
    *   Skills: Probability, linear algebra, calculus, statistical tests, machine learning theory.
    *   *Role:* Choosing the right algorithm, understanding if the results are significant, and avoiding common pitfalls.

3.  **Substantive Expertise / Business Acumen:**
    *   This is understanding the context of the problem you're trying to solve.
    *   Skills: Knowing the industry (finance, marketing, healthcare), asking the right questions, communicating findings to non-technical stakeholders.
    *   *Role:* Framing the problem correctly and ensuring the solution provides real business value.

**A data scientist lives at the intersection of all three.**

### 3. In-Class Activity & Discussion

**Prompt:** "Where have you interacted with data science today?"

*   Ask students to think about their morning/day so far and list examples.
*   Guide the discussion with these examples if needed:
    *   **Entertainment:** Netflix/YouTube/Spotify recommending a movie or song.
    *   **E-commerce:** Amazon suggesting "customers who bought this also bought...".
    *   **Social Media:** The order of posts in your Instagram or Twitter feed.
    *   **Navigation:** Google Maps predicting your arrival time based on current traffic.
    *   **Email:** Your spam filter automatically catching junk mail.

**Goal:** To make students realize that data science is not an abstract concept but a tangible part of their daily lives.

### 4. Session Wrap-up

*   Data Science is about converting raw data into actionable wisdom.
*   It requires a blend of programming, statistics, and business knowledge.
*   It is already deeply integrated into the products and services we use every day.
*   **Next Session:** We will explore the different types of data and the standard workflow that data scientists use to solve problems.
