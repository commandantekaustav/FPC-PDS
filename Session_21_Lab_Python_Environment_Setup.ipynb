    "#### What is Anaconda?\n",
    "Think of Anaconda as a big toolbox for data scientists. When you install it on your computer, it doesn't just install Python; it also installs over 100 of the most common data science libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.) and tools like Jupyter Notebook. It handles all the complex dependencies for you. For local development, it's the industry standard.\n",

    "#### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",

    "*   **Free Access to GPUs:** For advanced deep learning models, Colab provides free access to powerful hardware (GPUs) that can speed up training significantly.\n",
