    "1.  Understand the Interquartile Range (IQR) method for defining outliers.\n",
    "2.  Calculate Q1, Q3, and the upper/lower boundaries.\n",
    "3.  Apply a filter to the DataFrame to find data points that fall outside these boundaries.\n",
    "4.  Use a box plot as a quick and effective way to visualize potential outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we found no outliers in this specific case, this process is a vital part of data cleaning to ensure the quality of your analysis.\n",
