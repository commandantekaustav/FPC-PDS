    "\n",
    "In this lab, you explored the creative process of feature engineering:\n",
    "1.  **Interaction Features:** Creating new features by combining existing numerical ones (e.g., ratios).\n",
    "2.  **Binning:** Converting a numerical feature into a categorical one to capture broader trends.\n",
    "3.  **Combining Categories:** Creating a numerical feature by counting occurrences across several categorical columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good feature engineering is often the key to building a high-performing and interpretable machine learning model. It bridges the gap between raw data and business insight.\n",
