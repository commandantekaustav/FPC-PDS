    "\n",
    "In this lab, you learned how to look \"inside the black box\" of your predictive model:\n",
    "1.  Understand that coefficients in a Logistic Regression model represent the feature's influence on the probability of the outcome.\n",
    "2.  Extract the coefficients and feature names from a trained Scikit-learn model.\n",
    "3.  Create a summary table and visualization to rank features by their importance.\n",
    "4.  Use this information to explain *why* your model makes certain predictions, which is crucial for building trust and deriving actionable business insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our interpretation confirms that focusing on retaining customers with low tenure and month-to-month contracts is the correct business strategy.\n",

    "**Next Session:** We will discuss how to package these findings into a clear and concise summary for a business audience."
