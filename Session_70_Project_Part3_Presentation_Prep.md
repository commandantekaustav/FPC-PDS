# Session 70: Capstone Project Part 3 (Presentation Prep)

**Unit 6: Data Ethics, Privacy, and Future Trends**
**Hour: 70**
**Mode: Project Workshop**

---

### 1. Objective

This final workshop session is dedicated to preparing the final project deliverable: a short presentation aimed at the StyleSphere marketing team. The goal is to synthesize all the analysis into a clear, concise, and actionable story.

### 2. The Presentation Structure

A great data presentation is a story. Your story should have three acts:

*   **Act 1: The Situation.** (1 Slide)
    *   State the business problem: We need to improve marketing ROI by targeting the right customers.
    *   State your objective: We analyzed customer data to find the profile of a high-value, responsive customer.

*   **Act 2: The Key Insights.** (3-4 Slides)
    *   This is the core of your presentation. Dedicate one slide to each of your major findings.
    *   Use the powerful visualizations you created in Session 68.
    *   For each slide, have a clear, assertive title that states the finding (e.g., "High-Income Households are Our Most Responsive Segment").
    *   Use simple language to explain what the chart shows.

*   **Act 3: The Recommendation.** (1 Slide)
    *   Synthesize your findings into a coherent customer profile.
    *   Provide a clear, actionable recommendation for the marketing team.
    *   Briefly mention next steps (e.g., "We can build on this by creating a predictive model to score every customer.").

### 3. In-Class Activity: Build Your Slide Deck

**Instructions:**
In your groups, create a simple 5-slide presentation using Google Slides, PowerPoint, or a similar tool.

**Slide 1: Title Slide**
*   **Title:** Improving Marketing ROI by Targeting High-Value Customers
*   **Subtitle:** An Analysis of the StyleSphere Customer Base
*   **Your Group's Names**

**Slide 2: The High-Value Customer Spends More & Earns More**
*   **Action Title:** Responders Spend 2x More and Have 40% Higher Income
*   **Visuals:** Place your box plot of `Income by Response` and your bar chart of `Total_Spend by Response` side-by-side.
*   **Key Takeaway (Text on slide):** "Our most valuable customers (highest spenders) are also the ones most likely to respond to new offers. They have the income and the inclination to buy."

**Slide 3: The Target Customer is Engaged and Unencumbered**
*   **Action Title:** Recent Buyers and Customers Without Children Show Highest Response Rates
*   **Visuals:** Place your box plot of `Recency by Response` and your bar chart of `Response Rate by Children` side-by-side.
*   **Key Takeaway (Text on slide):** "Customers who have bought from us recently are primed for another offer. Furthermore, households without children represent a key opportunity, likely due to higher disposable income."

**Slide 4: Validating with Machine Learning**
*   **Action Title:** A Predictive Model Confirms These Key Drivers
*   **Visual:** A simplified version of your feature importance chart from Session 69.
*   **Key Takeaway (Text on slide):** "We built a baseline predictive model which confirmed that Total Spend, Recency, Children, and Income are the most powerful predictors of whether a customer will respond. This gives us high confidence in our findings."

**Slide 5: Recommendations & Next Steps**
*   **Title:** Our Recommendation: The "Prime Spender" Profile
*   **Define the Target Profile:**
    *   **Income:** > $68,000 (The average for responders)
    *   **Children:** 0 in the household
    *   **Recency:** Purchased in the last 35 days (The average for responders)
    *   **Total Spend:** > $1,000 over the last 2 years
*   **Actionable Recommendation:**
    *   "We recommend that the next email campaign should prioritize customers who match at least **three** of these four criteria."
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   "Launch a pilot campaign to this targeted segment and measure the uplift in response rate."
    *   "Develop a full-scale predictive model to score every customer on a daily basis."
