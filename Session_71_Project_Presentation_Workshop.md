# Session 71: Capstone Project Part 3 (Final Presentation Workshop)

**Unit 6: Data Ethics, Privacy, and Future Trends**
**Hour: 71**
**Mode: Project Workshop**

---

### 1. Objective

This session is the final preparation day before student presentations begin. The goal is for each group to finalize their slide deck, rehearse their talking points, and receive peer and instructor feedback in a workshop setting. This ensures that all presentations are polished, clear, and effectively communicate the project's findings.

### 2. Session Structure

This session is entirely hands-on and interactive, structured as follows:

1.  **Finalize Deck (20 minutes):** Groups will use the first part of the session to put the finishing touches on the 5-slide presentation deck they designed in Session 70.
2.  **Peer Review (30 minutes):** Each group will be paired with another group. They will take turns presenting their draft presentation to each other (~5 minutes per presentation) and then provide constructive feedback (~10 minutes for discussion).
3.  **Instructor Q&A (10 minutes):** The instructor will circulate and answer any final questions about the analysis, visualizations, or presentation structure.

### 3. Peer Feedback Guidelines

When reviewing another group's presentation, focus on the following criteria. The goal is to be helpful and constructive.

**The "Marketing Manager" Test:**
*   **Clarity:** Is the main message of each slide immediately obvious? Can you understand the key takeaway without a deep explanation?
*   **Simplicity:** Is the language free of technical jargon? Is it explained in clear business terms? (e.g., Instead of "the coefficient was -0.5", say "having children decreases the likelihood of responding").
*   **Actionability:** Is the final recommendation specific and actionable? Do you know exactly what the marketing team should do next?

**Visual Design:**
*   **Readability:** Are the fonts large enough to be read from a distance? Is there good contrast?
*   **Clutter:** Are the charts clean and easy to understand? Are there unnecessary gridlines, labels, or colors that could be removed?
*   **Focus:** Does the design (especially the use of color) effectively draw your attention to the most important part of each chart?

**Storytelling:**
*   **Narrative Flow:** Does the presentation follow the "Hook -> Evidence -> Recommendation" structure? Does it feel like a cohesive story?
*   **Assertive Titles:** Do the slide titles state the main finding, or are they just generic labels (e.g., "Income vs. Response" vs. "High Income Drives High Response")?

**Feedback Prompts:**
*   "The key insight on slide 3 was really clear because..."
*   "On slide 2, I was a bit confused by [specific chart element]. Have you considered...?"
*   "Your final recommendation is strong. To make it even more actionable, could you specify...?"
*   "The title of slide 4 could be more assertive. Instead of 'Model Results', what about...?"

### 4. Instructor's Final Checklist

- [ ] A clear and concise statement of the business problem on the first slide.
- [ ] Visualizations that directly support their key findings.
- [ ] Assertive, story-driven titles for each slide.
- [ ] Minimal jargon and clear, business-focused language.

### 5. Session Wrap-up

*   By the end of this session, every group should have a complete, rehearsed, and peer-reviewed presentation deck.
*   The focus should be on clear communication and actionable insights, not on the complexity of the code.
*   Remind students of the time limit for the final presentations (e.g., 5-7 minutes per group).
*   **Next Session:** The final presentations begin!
