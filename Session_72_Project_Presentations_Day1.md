### 3. Evaluation and Q&A Guidelines

The instructor and the student audience will evaluate the presentations based on the criteria established in the previous workshop.

#### For the Audience (Peer Evaluation):

As you listen to each presentation, consider the following:
1.  **The Core Message:** What was their single most important recommendation? Was it clear and easy to understand?
2.  **The Evidence:** Was their recommendation strongly supported by the data and visualizations they showed? Did you find their evidence convincing?
3.  **One Question:** Think of one clarifying question to ask during the Q&A. Good questions often start with:
    *   "Could you elaborate on why you chose to focus on...?"
    *   "That's an interesting finding on slide X. Did you also look at...?"
    *   "Based on your recommendation, what would be the very first action the marketing team should take?"

#### For the Instructor (Formal Evaluation):

The instructor will score each presentation based on a simple rubric:

| Category | Description | Score (1-5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Problem Framing** | Was the business problem and analytical goal clearly stated? | |
| **Data Storytelling** | Did the presentation follow a logical narrative (Hook, Evidence, Recommendation)? | |
| **Visual Clarity** | Were the charts easy to read, well-labeled, and effective at communicating the key insight? | |
| **Actionability** | Was the final recommendation specific, data-driven, and directly linked to the analysis? | |
| **Communication** | Was the presentation delivered clearly, professionally, and within the time limit? | |
| **Total Score** | | / 25 |

### 4. Session Wrap-up

*   The instructor will thank the presenting groups for their hard work and insightful analysis.
*   Common themes from the day's presentations will be discussed. For example:
    *   "Many groups successfully identified `Total_Spend` as a key predictor, which is a great insight."
    *   "A common area for improvement is making sure chart titles tell a story. Let's remember to use assertive titles."
*   **Next Session:** The capstone presentations will continue with the next set of groups.
