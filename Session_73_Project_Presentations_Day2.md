### 2. Session Format

This session follows the same structure as the previous day to ensure consistency.

*   **Instructor's Introduction (5 minutes):**
    *   Welcome the class back.
    *   Briefly recap the key takeaways and common feedback points from the previous presentation day. (e.g., "Yesterday, we saw some great examples of using box plots to compare distributions. Let's continue to focus on telling a clear story with our charts.").
    *   Reiterate the time limits (7 minutes to present, 3 minutes for Q&A).

*   **Group Presentations (45 minutes):**
    *   The next **4-5 groups** will present their findings.
    *   The instructor will manage the time.

*   **Wrap-up (10 minutes):**
    *   The instructor provides general feedback on the day's presentations.
    *   Praise specific examples of excellent work (e.g., "Group C did a fantastic job on their recommendation slide; it was very specific and actionable.").
    *   Announce the schedule for the final presentation day.

### 3. Evaluation and Q&A Guidelines

The evaluation process remains the same. The instructor and student audience will use the established criteria to provide feedback.

#### Focus for Today's Q&A:

To encourage deeper thinking, today's Q&A can focus more on the "so what" and the limitations of the analysis.

**Good questions for today might include:**
*   "Your analysis showed that income is a strong predictor. What are the potential **ethical implications** of targeting customers based on income?"
*   "You recommended targeting customers with zero children. Could this cause us to miss out on a potentially valuable long-term segment (e.g., new parents who will spend more later)? How could we test this?"
*   "Your data only covers the last two years. How might customer behavior have changed since then, and how would that affect your model?"
*   "What is one additional data source you wish you had for this project that would have made your analysis stronger?"
