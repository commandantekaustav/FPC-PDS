**Unit 6: Data Ethics, Privacy, and Future Trends**
**Hour: 74**
**Mode: Project Presentation**

---

### 1. Objective

This is the final day of capstone project presentations. The remaining groups will share their analysis of the StyleSphere dataset, bringing the project portion of the course to a close. The session will conclude with a summary of the project's key findings across all groups.

---

### 2. Session Format

*   **Instructor's Introduction (5 minutes):**
    *   Welcome the class to the final day of presentations.
    *   Briefly summarize the most consistent findings from the first two days (e.g., "A clear picture has emerged: our target customer is a high-spending, recently active individual, often with a high income and no children. Let's see if today's groups confirm or challenge these findings.").
    *   Remind the final groups of the time limits (7 min presentation, 3 min Q&A).

*   **Group Presentations (45 minutes):**
    *   The final **4-5 groups** will present their findings.
    *   The instructor will manage the time.

*   **Project Grand Summary (10 minutes):**
    *   After the final presentation, the instructor will lead a class discussion to synthesize the results from all groups.
    *   This is a critical step that simulates a real-world business outcome where a team of analysts consolidates their work into a single, unified recommendation.

### 3. Project Grand Summary Discussion

The instructor will facilitate this discussion using a whiteboard or by typing on screen.

**Discussion Prompts:**

1.  **Consensus on Key Predictors:**
    *   "Across all the presentations we saw, what were the **top 3-4 most consistent characteristics** of a customer who responds to the campaign?"
    *   (Write down student answers, which should converge on: High Total Spend, High Income, Low Recency, No Children).

2.  **Consensus on the Recommendation:**
    *   "Based on this consensus, if we had to write a single sentence to the Head of Marketing defining who to target, what would it be?"
    *   (Guide the class to synthesize a recommendation like: "We should target established, high-income customers without children who have made a purchase in the last month.").

3.  **Surprising or Contradictory Findings:**
    *   "Did any group present a finding that was surprising or seemed to contradict the main narrative? What was it?"
    *   (This is a great chance to discuss nuance in data analysis).

4.  **Project Limitations:**
    *   "What is the single biggest limitation of our analysis? What's a major risk or blind spot in our recommendation?"
    *   (Guide discussion towards topics like: the age of the data, the lack of data on *why* people churned, potential for bias, etc.).

### 4. Session Wrap-up

*   The instructor will formally congratulate **all** students on completing the capstone project, praising their hard work in progressing from raw data to a full-fledged, data-driven business recommendation.
*   The session concludes by emphasizing that data science is a team sport, and the ability to synthesize findings from multiple analyses into a single, coherent story is a key skill for senior analysts and managers.
*   **Next Session:** In our final session, we will wrap up the entire course and discuss pathways for continued learning.
